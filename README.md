# Launch container for web server on EC2 instance and access the home page of web application

## What is Docker?
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

## When to use Docker?
1. Use Docker as version control system for your entire app's operating system.
2. Use Docker when you want to distribute/collaborate on your app's operating system with a team.
3. Use Docker to run your code on your laptop in the same environment as you have on your server (try the building tool).
4. Use Docker when your software runs in different environments.
5. Use Docker when you want your software to be scalable and handle more users.
6. Use Docker when your hosting infrastructure may change in the future and you donâ€™t want to be locked.
